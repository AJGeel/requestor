# Requestor

This repository contains the high-fidelity demonstrator for the project 'Requestor — The Online Platform to Easily Share UX Works-in-Progress', the Final Master Project by Arthur Geel. This project was conducted as part of the Industrial Design M.Sc. programme at the Eindhoven University of Technology.

With this project I seek to explore the collaboration between User Experience (UX) Designers and their enterprise environments, with the aim to contribute a strategy to resolve problems that arise from the limited industry understanding and buy-in on the role of UX Design in enterprise environments. Paraphrased, with this work I seek an answer to the question:

> How might we create a better collaborative space for UX Designers and their environment?

This project is framed by a review of literature and trends, explaining the nuances in the problem statement. The design process is described, clarifying the design decisions made when taking an early concept to the final high-quality demonstrator, embodying my vision on addressing the outlined problem.

## Easier Sharing of Works-in-progress

With this tool, UX Designers can more easily share their works-in-progress with their (Non UX-designer) colleagues, and provide them with actionable instructions in order to provide feedback. Requestor allows interactive prototypes to be imported from popular design tools including [Figma](https://figma.com), [Adobe Xd](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html) and [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/).  

The purpose of this project is to help address problems related to [UX Maturity](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&q=ux+maturity) in business by providing enterprise with the tools to understand the role of UX. By juxtaposing interactive design prototypes with the actionable instructions required to understand- and evaluate the design, anyone is empowered to provide meaningful design feedback and contribute to the project.

## Multi-Modal Interactions

To non-experts, applying theoretical design frameworks in order to appraise and provide feedback to designs can be challenging and demanding. Since Requestor is designed with the vision to empower anyone to contribute to the design process, a part of the project was to understand which interaction modality makes the platform accessible to the non-expert user. Two interaction styles were explored in detail to understand their benefits and drawbacks:

### 'Traditional' User Interface

Firstly, we evaluated the 'traditional' Graphical User Interface &mdash; the web as we know it. The content is displayed graphically, layed out using the principles that we are familiar with from our years of using GUIs (i.e. visual hierarchy, contrast, proximity, negative space and feedforward on interactive elements).

This interaction style heavily relies on Progressive Disclosure to prevent walls of text from cognitively overloading the end-users. The end-user uses static headers, descriptions, buttons and text-areas to interact with the system.

### 'Conversational' User Interface

Alternatively, we have created a user interface which allows evaluators to interact with the system based on principles that more closely align with real-life human communication. Instead of the traditional 'point-and-click' interaction, evaluators can operate the interface by providing textual answers to the conversational agent.

## Evaluation Methods

The Requestor tool can practically support various design evaluation methods that can be used to explore a design prototype's success, based on the performance indicators that may matter for you. Below is a list of (scientific) design evaluation methods that could be used in the Requestor tool.

In the summative evaluation of this design concept, Jakob Nielsen's Usability Heuristics were implemented.

## Project Report, Evaluation, Results and Analysis

As the Requestor project was conducted as part of the Industrial Design M.Sc. programme at the Eindhoven University of Technology, a comprehensive report will be published that details its design process, evaluation, results and analysis. The report will be published on Thursday, June 11<sup>th</sup>.
