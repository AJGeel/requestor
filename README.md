# Requestor (working title)

This is a web application that is used to share Figma works-in-progress for evaluation with others. For this demonstration, an UX Evaluation of the Dutch e-commerce site known as [Bol.com](https://bol.com) is used. However, this will probably be changed to something less copyright intensive as this project continues.

Check out [a demo](https://arthurgeel.com/requestor/) of the latest build.

## Easier Sharing of Works-in-progress

With this tool, UX Designers can more easily share their works-in-progress with their (Non UX-designer) colleagues, and provide them with actionable instructions in order to provide feedback. The functionality of this application will be linked with the [Evaluator](https://github.com/AJGeel/figma-sample-plugin) Plugin for Figma in the future.

The purpose of this project is to help address problems related to [UX Maturity](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&q=ux+maturity) in business by providing enterprise with the tools to understand the role of UX.

## Evaluation Methods

Currently, the plugin contains placeholders that will support the following UX Evaluation methods in future releases:
